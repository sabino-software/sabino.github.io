A software engineer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil currently working
as data engineer at [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br)

When not working, I might be [blogging](https://sabino.github.io),
hacking [opensource](https://github.com/sabino) software,
making some [musics](https://soundcloud.com/felipe-guilherme-sabino),
taking some [pictures](https://instagram.com/sabino)

I've got a lot of interest in Docker, Java, NodeJS, automation bots (like Hubot),
ETL technologies, alternative problem solving.

I do play keyboard, I consider myself a pianist.
